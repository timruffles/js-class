This training course will demystify the inner workings of the JS language and execution model, before developing advanced skills. It delivers the core language knowledge required for developers to make effective use of JS, whether that's on the backend with Node, or on the front-end with frameworks.

The class is exercise-driven, so youâ€™ll be writing code from the start.

Deep dive into core Javascript: scope, closures, functions
    - TO: reason about scope
    - TO: use closures to wrap functions, and pass around context
    - TO: pick the correct function sync for a scenario, and understand how they work
Data structures: objects, arrays, maps and sets
    - TO: know which data-structures to pick for job at hand
    - TO: make effective use of array standard library
    - TO: have good grasp of key/value data idioms
ES5/ES6/ES20xx
    - TO: understand flavours of language, and how to keep up
Avoiding gotchas
    - TO: understand potential issues in modern JS, and address with tooling
Module systems: CommonJS, ES6
    - TO: make effective use of module systems, and understand the interop challenges
Asynchronous code, call-stacks and the event loop
    - TO: design programs that work efficiently and reliably around the event loop
Handling async: async functions, promises and generators
    - TO: design async programs using promises
    - TO: design async programs using async functions
Debugging skills
