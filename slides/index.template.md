intro

# We need to get handy with the syntax and
# basic execution environment of JS.

# This lesson will pitch a piece of code using
# functions, flow control, primitives and variables
# that we will be able to full comprehend by the end.

# - functions
#   - writing and reading declaration/expressions, picking between
#   - using first class nature
#       - passing in functions
#       - returning functions
#   - destructuring
#   - understanding arrow functions (minus this)
#   - making deliberate use of closures
#   - motivates: scope
#       - hoisting
# - variables
#   - reference vs value
#   - reasoning about scope
#   - when to use let/const/var
# - primitives
#   - string templates
#   - numbers
#   - comparison

reasoning about scope

primitives


functions basic
closures

# - objects system
#   - confidently reason about deferencing, keys, etc
#   - reasoning correctly about how object keys work
#   - use as data-transfer, JSON
#   - understanding limitations as a container
# - objects proper
#   - when to use, motivation
#   - class syntax

objects

# Lets solve problems with data
#
# Data-structures will allow us to perform more interesting
# work.
#
# - arrays
#   - using for ordered data
#   - using as a queue
#   - point to lodash
# - maps
#   - seeing how it 'fills in' object's weakness
#   - e.g keeping relationships between DOM els and something else
# - sets
#   - seeing how a clean/fast way to track membership
# - general
#   - indexing - types of key
#   - referencing, deferencing etc
#   - structures reference values, they don't 'hold' them, so we don't copy by assignment

# Let's build programs that can interact - with users and the world.
#
# Asynchronicity is required once we want our programs to do real
# work.
#
# - writing effective code in a single threaded environment
# - using callbacks effectively
#   - always async
#   - ticks of the loop
# - promises
#   - values rather than imperative
# - async functions
#   - brings async into the language
#   - exceptions
