intro

# we need to get handy with the syntax and
# basic execution environment of JS

# this lesson will pitch a piece of code using
# functions, flow control, primitives and variables
# that we will be able to full comprehend by the end

# - functions
#   - motivation: cohesive chunks of code, keeping problems small
#   - writing and reading declaration/expressions, picking between
#   - motivates: scope
#   - using first class nature
#       - passing in functions
#       - returning functions
#   - destructuring
#   - understanding arrow functions (minus this)
#   - making deliberate use of closures
# - variables
#   - reference vs value
#   - reasoning about scope
#   - when to use let/const/var
reading core javascript challenge


# lets start problems with data
#
# data-structures will allow us to perform more interesting
# work, so we dig into them
#
# - objects
#   - confidently reason about deferencing
#   - reasoning correctly about how object keys work
#   - use as data-transfer, JSON
#   - understanding limitations as a container
# - arrays
#   - using for ordered data
#   - using as a queue
#   - point to lodash
# - maps
#   - seeing how it 'fills in' object's weakness
# - sets
#   - seeing how a clean/fast way to track membership
# - general
#   - indexing - types of key
#   - referencing, deferencing etc
#   - structures reference values, they don't 'hold' them, so we don't copy by assignment
solving problems with data

# let's build programs that can interact - with users and the world
#
# asynchronicity is key once we want our programs to do real
# work, so we'll look at a program that does that and use it
# it to learn about:
#
# - writing effective code in a single threaded environment
# - using callbacks effectively
#   - always async
#   - ticks of the loop
# - promises
#   - values rather than imperative
# - async functions
doing real work challenge

# From there we need to consider structuring larger programs. For that
# we will likely need to consider using some objects to track essential
# state
#
# - understanding concept of state
#   - why objects help here
#   - class syntax
writing larger programs challenges
