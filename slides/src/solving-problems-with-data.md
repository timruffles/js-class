## Solving problems with data structures
{title:1}

## Choose the right data structure

> Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships

Linus Torvalds

## Why?

- write less code - let the structure do the work for you
- performance - data structure often makes the difference
- language independent knowledge

## Example problems

- count the number of times we've seen an item
- write a queue to keep order of undo items
- associate meta-data with DOM elements
- efficiently filter out duplicate elements
